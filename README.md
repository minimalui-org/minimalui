# Minimal UI
Don't reinvent the wheel. Create beautiful React Native apps by using Minimal UI, a set of reusable components for all your basic needs. Extends the existing ones, create your own theme and build new modern apps.
Minimal UI is ready to use for React Native on Android, iOS and Web. We believe in the "code once, deploy everywhere" philosophy so all of our components are cross-platforms and we have dedicated components for screen size responsiveness.
The library is written in Typescript and will work with both Javascript and Typescript projects. All the type definitions are exported directly from the main library.
